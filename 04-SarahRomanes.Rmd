Hi! I'm Sarah, a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Sydney. I am under the supervision of Dr John Ormerod and Prof. Jean Yang, working in the areas of approximate inference and bioinformatics. In my spare time, I like to go rock climbing, travel, and let everyone know how much I dislike coriander. I also love memes and bombard my students with them whilst lecturing.

## Section 2: Thoughts


It's been very useful to have the step by step examples for section 2. When I have previously tried to learn tidy, I was learning commands on the fly and struggled with the functions of each command. Was especially useful to see how mutate actually works! 

### Most useful skill - the gather function.

I still think I will need to become more familiar with the gather function. But the religion example was a nice easy one to get started with.

I can try with the classic Iris dataset to test my understanding a bit more.

I can turn this:
```{r}
head(iris)
```

Into a long version like this:
```{r}
iris_tidy <- iris %>% gather(measurements, vals, -Species)
head(iris_tidy)
```

And boxplot it much easier:
```{r}
iris_tidy %>% ggplot(aes(x=measurements, y=vals,fill=measurements))+geom_boxplot()
```
