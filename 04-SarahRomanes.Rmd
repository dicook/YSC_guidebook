## About me 

Hi! I'm Sarah, a PhD student in Statistics at the University of Sydney. I am under the supervision of Dr John Ormerod and Prof. Jean Yang, working in the areas of approximate inference and bioinformatics. In my spare time, I like to go rock climbing, travel, and let everyone know how much I dislike coriander. I also love memes and bombard my students with them whilst lecturing.
