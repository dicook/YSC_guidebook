# I reckon...

Hello! My name is Katy Proctor, I'm originally from Scotland but moved to Perth 5 years ago. I graduated last year and now work as a Graduate Statistician at Data Analysis Australia. 

I reckon that the spread, gather and separate functions will make reformatting client's data a lot easier and will make the process of producing plots more efficient.
